- After class12, I was not much interested in CS and learning C++ was not much useful as well. 
- Computer science was the only subject where I lost A+ in class 12 with 92 marks.
- Joined MEC and learned Python. Python was the first programming language which was so easy and intutive to follow for
  me as beginner, it was part of KTU sylabus then(not anymore).
 - In MEC, we have a vibrant coding culture. When I initially came, i realised how much better my peers were in
   programming and other stuff. This helped me tinker by installing various linux distributions in my first year(more
   than 5 linux distros) and start learning programming.
- I attended ISQUIP(5 day workshop+hackathon), in CEC Chengannur from where I learned HTML/CSS/JS, Django and won first prize in a Hackathon conducted there.
- As our team was able to get first prize, I got an internship at Entri.me as Rahul Ramesh, Django instructor who taught me in ISQUIP was the CTO there.
- That is the best thing about any Tech event(be it a meetup/Conference): You get to learn new things from people, network with CEOs/CTO's in a relaxed
  fashion(I have met Director of DataScience, Microsoft when having a tea), get amazing mentors who help you in your
  learning journey(Gopi, Praveen, ) and free food/swags.

- Working in a product-based startup, in my first year itself was a big thing. I was able to learn so much more about Django(a
  backend framework) and Python. 
-  After the internship worked on more projects in WebDevelopment, mainly in Django. This is the reason for my IRC nick: django_master.
- Slowly got involved in College communities and  learned about Open source through FOSSMEC in our college, with member
  actively contributing to Open source and few folks even got GSoC.
- I became part of Excel Tech team.  

- My first open source contribution was to some projects my friends worked. I heard having a streak and lot of github
  green dots help in getting good job from some random folks.
- So I have about 750+ contributions per year for more than two years now in github. 
- "Just contribute to Open source, opportunies will fly towards you" - Mario Behling, Co-founder FOSS
- FOSSASIA OpenTechNights Winner - got an opportunity to FOSSASIA International Summit, Singapore.
- Met lot of amazing developers and mentors though Open source - VLC founders, Mario Behling, Sayan Chaudhary, Kushal
  Das, Ivan Shcheklein, Santhosh thottigal, Biswaz

- Pycon India, most valuable conference in India IMO @Rs 1000 for students. You get best conference experience in India
  with lot of experts, a must visit for any developer regardless of language.
- Chennai Edition was my second time and this was my first time presenting a full Tech talk.
- I talked about ML Models and Dataset versioning using DVC(a tool like git for ML). Giving a Tech talk is a fantastic
  experience.
- Recently became a Kaggle expert(rank 500 now)
